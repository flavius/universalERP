      Our company has multiple online shops. From the outside, regular 
      customer can just buy our products, but there is also a back-end for 
      managing these products.
    </p>
    <p>
      The back-end can manage products of any other shop, but if a shop 
      becomes unavailable, those products should not be visible any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the front-end, also the regular user can start shopping in one of the 
      shops, but he can &quot;migrate&quot; his shopping cart to another shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end, the order is put under the last shop's authority, but the 
      back-end should be aware of where each product came from into the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the data generated across the entire company must be readily 
      available for further data analysis: we like to know everything, even if 
      we don't yet know what we are going to do with all this data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The security of the data is very important, so if the data of one shop 
      gets lost (for whatever unforeseeable reason), anything else but that 
      shop must continue to work properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since performance is also an important feature, we want to be able to 
      move each shop to its own server, but at the same time we also like to 
      test new shops while keeping the costs low.
    </p>
    <p>
      Security is also important, it's imperative to know who, what, and when 
      any of our employees has changed something.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are different access levels for our employees, some are 
      company-wide, others are shop-local. Some things may be modifiable for 
      some, and just visible for others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each shop can be localized for a country, since we sell our products 
      world-wide. We also have translators which should be able to see which 
      products have a missing translation in the language(s) they know. 
      Products which are missing a translation should not be visible in the 
      front-end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The types of products which we sell are quite variate. Most of them are 
      physical products, but we can also sell virtual products like online 
      courses, tickets to events, subscriptions for regular orders. We store 
      most of our products in our warehouse, but there are some products which 
      are either stored somewhere else, or we need to send out a manufacturing 
      order to some of our partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also discounts to some products, which can expire after a 
      certain amount of time, or after a certain amount has been sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our customers can also buy vouchers or introduce a voucher code. 
      Vouchers, just like discounts, can also be restricted to only some 
      products.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also deliver products on behalf of our business partners, or on the 
      contrary, some of our partners deliver our products on our behalf. 
      Either way, we should be able to see the most accurate amount of money 
      we have in the back-end.
